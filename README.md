scraping Indeed vacancies + NLP preprocessing

I analyzed an American worldwide employment-related search engine Indeed.com to get most sought job propositions skills and "2018 Kaggle ML & DS Survey" from Kaggle.com.

I got 1078 unique links of Data Science vacancies and 251 with compensation information, made exploratory data analysis and made a prediction about used tools which have effected on raising the compensation of 15429 survey participants. 

In the beginning, i made frequencies analysis of phrases and words into job descriptions. Let's see some results:

Tech skills took up top positions: 'machine learning', 'year experience', 'predictive model', 'statistical analysis', 'deep learning', 'quantitative field', 'large datasets', 'deep learning' and then 'communication skill' and 'innovative idea'.
Most frequencies have words: experience, team, statistical, quantitative, insight, visualization, communication.

To have cross-functional team skills will be beneficial.

'Computer science', 'software development', 'relational database' requires a strong tech background. 
'predictive modeling', 'large datasets', 'visualization tool', 'summarization query', 'actionable insight' are saying about necessity growing up an ability to work with big data, make reasonable summarizing and indicate new unexpected findings.
Analyzing filtered data with compensation of more than $100th from Indeed did not mark to change general conclusions.

For me personally, for "young" data scientist, this Kaggle survey is so exciting. Many experts gathered on this amazing resource and are ready to share the experience by answering questions.
My exploratory data analysis revealed: 
- much tech languages got top positions after Python, R, and SQL such as Java, C/C++, C#/.NET, Javascript/Typescript. To implement ML solution to product requires using low-level programming languages to raise competitive of one's.

- ML library used the most: 'Scikit-Learn', 'TensorFlow', 'Keras', 'randomForest', 'Caret', 'PyTorch', 'Xgboost' and data visualization library Matplotlib', 'ggplot2', 'Seaborn', 'Plotly’.

Respondents could have multiple choices (so probably a lot of people that checked self-taught also checked online courses). More than half the respondents consider themself to be self-taught while only 30% consider that University played a role in their teaching. 
- platforms are mainly used for online learning: respondents could have multiple choices as well. Coursera took up the top of respondents with the big gap.
- More than 55% of respondents find that online courses are either slightly better or much better than what they get in universities. In other words, the online courses are providing a much needed content to students from countries that either can't study ML at their schools or have courses that aren't that good. 
- we could find that all stage of ML get time and 'Cleaning data' the much.
- media sources might be helpful to understand current industry trends, to stay on top of the latest news. There is a big part of how to stay competitive, remain valuable, and grow own expertise. Favorite media sources that report on data science topics for Data Scientists and Data Analysts are: 'Medium Blog Posts', 'Kaggle forums', 'KDnuggets Blog','r/machinelearning', 'ArXiv & Preprints'.
- cloud computing products offers a broad set of global cloud-based products including compute, storage, databases, analytics, networking, mobile, developer tools, management tools, IoT, security and enterprise applications. These services help organizations move faster, lower IT costs, and scale. 'AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)', 'Google Compute Engine', 'AWS Lambda', 'Azure Virtual Machines' are using at work or school more often by Kaggle respondents.

To make a prediction about using tools from Kaggle survey was like opening Pandora's box. 
I had to stop to try different methods in the new area to me and my current knowledge to flow me into... sometimes results in headlong changes …and I've stopped on accuracy about 42% and on hope to be able to do more in the near future.

Findings most sought skills to get more money:
- is using big data and analytics products: AWS Redshift, IBM Cloud Analytics Engine, AWS Athena, Snowflake; machine learning products: Amazon Transcribe, DataRobot, Azure Speaker Recognition API; relational database products: IBM Cloud Compose, Google Cloud Bigtable; cloud computing products: AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2); machine learning frameworks: Mxnet, Prophet, Fastai.
- to work with ‘Time Series Data’ Type of Data; Prog. Languages C#/.NET, Jupyter/IPython’.
- to have the expertise of using ML methods many years.
But can we say our captured data are random?
